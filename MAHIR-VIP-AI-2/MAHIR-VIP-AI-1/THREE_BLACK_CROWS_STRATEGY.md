## 🛡️ Safety Margin Rules (15-20% Buffer Zone)

### What is Safety Margin?
A **safety margin** is a protective buffer that reduces risk by ensuring you don't enter trades at extreme price levels.

### Implementation:
1. **Price Buffer:** Only trade when price is 15-20% away from recent support/resistance
2. **Time Buffer:** Wait 1-2 candles after pattern confirmation
3. **Volatility Check:** Avoid trading during high-impact news events
4. **Market Hours:** Trade during active market hours (avoid low liquidity periods)

### Safety Checklist:
- [ ] Pattern confirmed with 3rd candle close
- [ ] Price not at extreme support level
- [ ] No major news events in next 5 minutes
- [ ] Adequate trading volume
- [ ] Market trending or consolidating (not choppy)

## 💰 One-Step MTG (Money Management)

### What is One-Step MTG?
**One-Step Money Management** means you **DO NOT MARTINGALE**. You trade with a fixed stake and accept the result.

### Core Principles:

#### 1. Fixed Stake Size
- **Recommended:** 1-2% of total capital per trade
- **Maximum:** 5% of total capital per trade
- **Never exceed** your predetermined risk limit

#### 2. No Recovery Trading
- ❌ **DO NOT** double your stake after a loss
- ❌ **DO NOT** chase losses with bigger trades
- ✅ **DO** stick to your fixed stake size
- ✅ **DO** accept losses as part of trading

#### 3. Position Sizing Formula
```
Trade Amount = Total Capital × Risk Percentage
Example: $1000 capital × 2% = $20 per trade
```

#### 4. Daily Loss Limit
- **Stop trading** after 3 consecutive losses
- **Maximum daily loss:** 5-10% of capital
- **Take a break** and review your strategy
